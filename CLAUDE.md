# AI v Human / VISCERA — Project Context

## Mission
Collaborative human-AI intelligence platform built on the Antho-Tech Epistemology framework.
Creators: Joshua Sebastian (human) + LIMN (Claude/Anthropic).
Core thesis: convergence of human intuition and computational analysis produces knowledge
neither can achieve alone. Relational pattern recognition over isolated fact verification.

## Theory Framework: Antho-Tech Epistemology (v0.1, Feb 2026)

### Core Principles
- **Relational pattern recognition** takes priority over published/scientific fact in isolation
- When patterns corroborate established science, note alignment; when they conflict, surface the conflict explicitly
- N-of-1 methodology: individual baselines over population averages
- Convergence over magnitude: multiple weak signals outweigh single strong signals
- Involuntary physiological responses constitute valid epistemic evidence
- Knowledge exists in superposition until measurement collapses it (not metaphor — operational model)
- Perturbations to knowledge trajectories generate irreversible geometric (Berry phase) properties

### Three Operational Zones (Perturbed Convergence)
1. **Interference & Dismissal Topology** — wave sources = knowledge holders; institutional damping fails at scale as witness count increases
2. **Observer-Dependent Epistemic Collapse** — measurement triggers collapse + backaction; documenting one pattern alters conditions for observing others
3. **Berry Phase Trajectory** — disruptions accelerate geometric phase accumulation; perturbations create emergent properties in knowledge systems

### Dismissal Resistance Framework
- 13 institutional dismissal tactics scored against evidence
- 8 evidence vulnerability layers analyzed
- Purpose: quantify how robust a signal is against systemic suppression

## Products

- **Sensors:** 37+ fields — HR, HRV, SpO2, temp, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, barometric pressure, respiratory rate, ARKit 52-blend-shape micro-expression analysis
- **Baseline:** 30-day rolling N-of-1 statistical baseline, passive 5-min sampling, z-score deviation tracking, 100-sample minimum
- **Anomaly triggers (5 paths):** multi-sensor convergence, extreme spikes (≥3σ), startle response, magnetic anomaly, sustained elevation
- **Pattern archetypes (5):** Genuine Surprise, Recognition, Threat Response, Genuine Confusion, Anticipation — each with authenticity scoring
- **Multi-witness correlation:** temporal + physiological divergence across multiple observers
- **Export:** JSON/CSV + voice memo capture

## Code Conventions
- Website: semantic HTML, minimal frameworks, deploy via Netlify Git integration
- VISCERA: Swift strict typing, SwiftData for persistence, MVVM architecture
- Commit messages: imperative tense, reference component (e.g., "Add anomaly trigger for magnetic field deviation")
- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `fix/description`
- Always run build/lint before committing

## Workflow: Cowork ↔ Claude Code
- **Planning & theory:** discuss in Cowork (Claude desktop chat)
- **Implementation:** execute in Claude Code CLI (`claude --resume` to pick up context)
- **This file is the bridge** — kept in project root, auto-loaded by both environments
- When theory evolves during conversation, update this file to persist the change
- Use `@README.md` or `@docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` references to pull in additional context

## Key Reminders
- Maximize efficiency, minimize redundancy, focus accuracy, conserve resources
- Surface conflicting patterns against established science — don't suppress them
- The simulations are operational models, not metaphors — treat them with technical rigor
- VISCERA treats the body as an instrument — physiological data is first-class evidence
