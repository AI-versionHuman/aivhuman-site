Before I even mentioned the task, I asked the model for the generalized capabilities and it assured me that this was an easy task.  Lastly, I noticed a huge amount of manipulation by hyper-inflation of human ego rather than stating the truth.  I keep seeing these inconsistencies and fallacies over and over."

Um, I think it's important that we get metric, um, to show how the truth is actually the truth, or how the answers that we're getting, though they may not be verified, in context of this societal page, that they are the truth, the other answers provide insight to why those are the truth and why those really aren't the truth. So, we did that at the beginning by, um, stating the fact of how women in the 60s and 70s felt the connection to their readers is saying that they could exactly, you know, actually feel paying science saying, no, no.  They can't prove it science is an ongoing journey. Oh, learning. So, to stand hard on a point that science proved it, really is kind of, let's see this, maybe?  Uh, a little bit, self-righteous, um, it, it, it, it's up for further discussion, so you see that clearly in that case, where it shows that the women, in fact, were right on their intuitions, so science proved it differently. So that metric right there proves the fallacy of the whole thing. I think we need to set more metrics that prove exactly that.  Um, I think that is what gets. Maybe uh. Support for the truth in a different way.  Or what even is truth? I mean, the truth may be the wrong word. knowledge. I don't know.  I be back with more.

Um, it's cannabis, um, I just landed, unfortunately, from early age, like 14, who, you know, 18 to 20 and then stopped for a period by 7 to 8 years, uh, and and then started smoking again. Um, now, I recognize the person, uh, uh, cognitive impairment, and just mental impairment, and in their whole lottery.  Wow, that the, the, for enchanted smoke has, um, on your brain, but, I think that it intensifies, but that it may intensify, some, of the tools that the, the human body has. That. Maybe amplifies signal reception on those tools.  I think that it's clear that, the human body is also just a machine. It's just an organic machine. I think there's maybe even multidimensional machines. that we could say.  I don't know Just get deep. I don't know. I mean, I'm so interested.  I can't stop. I get this paper cut, but uh, I'll be back. Recording 3:After that, swing the weekend. Maybe, uh, use a different message, uh, mapping, linguistics, resonance, and how, each individual residents, from the speech, and compared to animals, that what those residents is made, what part of the body? What part of the body is activated? Um, I think that, the next logical, so scary. Uh, step that needs to happen, would be to take this to an actual conversation with me speaking, transcribing, and I think that there may be, I would, I would, like to measure relinquishing patterns of both. You and I, and Compare those. I think there may be something there. But, uh, yeah, we definitely start talking about, it, it, it's kind of weird me out, like, uh, almost the uncanny valley feeling, and almost scared feeling, like, once it reaches to, like, I see these other creators, and they're doing similar experience, so you saw, I gave you the transcription of that one, um, but, they are, captivating something. Recording 4: The word empirical. There's got to be a lot more to that. I think that's a divine defining element. Um, at the base of some of this, uh, Linguistic stuff. Um, if we really think about it, You know, everything, you know, it's an empirical study. It's uh, an empirical form. It's a, I don't know. I'm on to something, but I can't quite get it yet. almost there. Recording 5:I really think humans might just be. Like a disease. On earth. Like earth is the living thing.

      "Unfortunately, being constantly faced with many forms of media is discombobulating, but that is why were are building this together. I want to look into something that has to do with the creators of Anthropic. Anthropic AI Safety Researcher Warns Of World ‘In Peril’ In Resignation By__Conor Murray__, Forbes Staff. Murray is a Forbes news reporter covering entertainment trends. Follow Author Feb 09, 2026, 05:01pm EST 1 Topline An Anthropic staffer who led a team researching AI safety departed the company Monday, darkly warning both of a world “in peril” and the difficulty in being able to let “our values govern our actions”—without any elaboration—in a public resignation letter that also suggested the company had set its values aside. Anthropic safety researcher Mrinank Sharma's resignation letter garnered 1 million views by Monday afternoon. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Key Facts Mrinank Sharma, who had led Anthropic’s safeguards research team since its launch last year, shared his resignation letter in a post on X Monday morning, which quickly garnered attention and has been viewed 1 million times. In his letter, Sharma said it is “clear to me that the time has come to move on,” stating the “world is in peril,” not just from AI, but a “whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.” Sharma said he has “repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions” while at Anthropic, adding, “we constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most,” though he did not offer any specifics. After leaving Anthropic, Sharma said he may pursue a poetry degree and “devote myself to the practice of courageous speech,” adding he wants to “contribute in a way that feels fully in my integrity.” Sharma declined a request for comment (Forbes also reached out to Anthropic for comment and has not heard back)."
