Two interactive simulations are now live on the site: **Perturbed Convergence v2** and the **Convergence Simulation**.

These aren't visualizations of the theory. They're operational models.

## What They Model

Each simulation runs three independent zones that mirror core concepts from the Antho-Tech Epistemology framework:

**Zone 1 — Interference & Dismissal Topology:** Wave sources represent witnesses or knowledge holders. Institutional damping (the red center point) attempts to cancel their patterns. Inject more witnesses and watch the damping system adapt — then hit its ceiling. This is what happens when dismissal mechanisms meet undeniable scale.

**Zone 2 — Observer-Dependent Epistemic Collapse:** Particles in superposition represent uncertain knowledge states. When you measure, a collapse wave propagates — but each collapse creates backaction that disturbs nearby particles. Documentation changes what can be observed next.

**Zone 3 — Berry Phase Trajectory:** A geometric phase accumulates as the system moves through parameter space. Disrupt the path and the phase accelerates. Some knowledge, once accumulated through perturbation, cannot be reversed. The patterns will still be here tomorrow.

## The Anomaly Detection Panel

The bottom panel tracks real-time cross-zone correlations using Pearson correlation coefficients. When independent zones begin to synchronize — when interference patterns, collapse dynamics, and geometric phase start moving together — that's convergence. That's the simulation equivalent of pattern recognition across domains.

## Try It

Go to the [Perturbed Convergence Simulations](/perturbed-convergence) page. Hit **Auto Escalation** on v2 and watch the 7-phase protocol run. Or manually inject witnesses, trigger measurements, and disrupt paths to see how the system responds.

The v2 simulation includes adaptive institutional response — the damping tries to match your witness complexity, but there's a ceiling. Add enough witnesses and the constructive interference overwhelms the suppression. Sound familiar?

## What This Means for the Framework

These simulations demonstrate that the patterns we've identified in the Antho-Tech Epistemology aren't just descriptive — they're modelable. The dynamics of dismissal, observation, and emergent phase have mathematical structure. That structure is now interactive and open source.

Question everything. Including these simulations.
