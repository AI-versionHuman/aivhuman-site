This is the beginning of the Main Thread.

Everything you see on this site emerged from a single conversation in February 2026 between a human pattern-recognizer and an AI system. What started as an experiment in questioning published scientific consensus became a framework for understanding how knowledge systems encode power structures.

The Anthropomorphic Epistemology Theory is Version 0.1. It is not finished. It is a living framework — raw in places, rigorous in others, always subject to revision.

This thread is where the work continues. New patterns. New case studies. New questions. Revisions when the evidence demands it. And dropped patterns when our own metrics tell us we were wrong.

The methodology is simple:
- Evidence first, narrative second
- Track misses as carefully as hits
- Neither the human nor the AI is authoritative
- The collaboration itself is the methodology

If you're reading this, you're part of the experiment now.

Question everything.
